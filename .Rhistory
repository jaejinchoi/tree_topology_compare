## Process
1. Collect trees (tree file format supported by Dendropy, e.g., Newick or Nexus) from given file paths.
2. Keep and compare shared operation taxon units (OTUs) between two trees for comparison.
3. Score branchings by comparing topology between trees, a reference tree vs. other trees, using two scoring types by default.
* H1: shared branching between trees of identical OTUs, e.g., concensus.
* H2: shared branching between trees of partially shared OTUs, e.g., Jack-Knife Monophyly Indexing (JMI).
